# Mars-Rover

## About this project
I worked on this project for the Udacity Nanodegree *Intermediate JavaScript*, and it represent a start page with three possible rovers: *Spirit*, *Opportunity* and *Curiosity*. If you click on them you can see the latest images from Mars. It's a responsive project. In this project I also used the Functional paradigm with *Immutable.js*.

## Tools
To complete this project I've used: 
- *HTML*
- *CSS*
- *JavaScript*
- *JSON*
- *Git*
- *NPM* 
- *Node.js* 
- *Express* 
and also the **NASA** *API*. 

## How to run the project
To run the project you can use this command: `npm start`. However, the command line returned me a problem with *DOTENV*, so I run the following command: `npm install dotenv` and then `npm install --dotenv-extended`. This helped me to fix the problem.
